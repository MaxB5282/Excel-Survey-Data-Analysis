### Summary of Data

From the data we were able to see that the computing majors were just much more interested in taking more computing classes. The majority of women and men that were not computing majors did not have a big interest in taking more computing classes.

With this insight CCM needs to dive into where this lack of interest really comes from. Could most women at CCM be naive to the wonder world of computing. Or are women fully aware of all of this and still not interested.
